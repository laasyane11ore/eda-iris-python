# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on IRIS Dataset
This repository contains Python code that performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using popular data visualization libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data analysis, and this code provides various visualizations to better understand the dataset.
## Contents
1. IRIS.ipynb - python script containing EDA code
2. README.md - This documentation file
 
## Code Explanation
The Python script in this repository performs the following tasks:
1. Imports necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.
2. Loads the Iris dataset using Seaborn's `load_dataset` function.
3. Displays basic information about the dataset using `iris.info()`.
4. Displays the first few rows of the dataset using `iris.head()`.
5. Presents summary statistics of the dataset using `iris.describe()`.
6. Creates a pairplot to visualize relationships between features, colored by species.
7. Generates a box plot to visualize the distribution of sepal length by species.
8. Constructs a correlation heatmap to visualize feature correlations.
9. Performs univariate analysis by plotting histograms for each feature.
10. Performs bivariate analysis by creating a pairplot colored by species and another scatterplot matrix.
Each step of the code is accompanied by explanations and comments for clarity.
## Results and Visualizations
The following visualizations are generated by the provided code:
1. **Pairplot:** This visualization showcases relationships between pairs of features in the Iris dataset. Different species are differentiated by colors.
2. **Box Plot:** This plot displays the distribution of sepal length for each species using box plots. It helps to visualize the spread and central tendency of the data.
3. **Correlation Heatmap:** The heatmap illustrates the correlations between different features. Positive and negative correlations are represented by colors.
4. **Univariate Analysis - Histograms:** Individual histograms for each feature provide insights into the distribution of values within the dataset.
5. **Bivariate Analysis - Pairplot and Scatterplot Matrix:** The pairplot colored by species and scatterplot matrix offer visualizations of relationships between features and species.
Each visualization is generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries, enhancing the understanding of the Iris dataset's characteristics.
## Usage Instructions
To run the code in this repository and generate the visualizations:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/eda-iris-python.git`.
4. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd eda-iris-python`.
5. Run the Python script: `python IRIS.ipynb`.
6. The code will generate visualizations and display them in separate plots.
Feel free to customize the code, modify visualizations, or incorporate it into your own projects.
## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the Iris dataset, offering valuable insights into the relationships and characteristics of different Iris species. The code and visualizations can serve as a foundation for further data analysis, machine learning, or visualization projects.
